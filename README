  V0.5 - Centered chessboard with pieces, and row and column names
  - Chess pieces are implemented using one span each, which contains
    the proper unicode character to render it.
    Pieces are positioned using CSS classes for rows and cols

  - Row and column labels are decoration, not content. For that reason
    choice has been made to implement them using CSS.
    Since it is impossible to have multiple :before or :after
    pseudo-classes, an additional div embedding the chessboard is needed.

    One difficulty is that there is no way to fix or know the width of
    characters, or character spacing (meaning the horizontal space from the
    start of one character to the start of the next one). For that
    I chose a fixed width font, specified the character height (aka
    the ex and em units), guessed the aspect ratio of the characters,
    and minimized the errors by distributing them left and right of
    a centered string instead of adding them from left to right).

  V0.4 - Centered chessboard
  - Centered Chessboard using CSS3 viewport percentage units, anc calc()

  - Tested with :

    Firefox 20.0 for Windows ......... [OK]

    Internet Explorer 10.0 for Windows [partially OK]
    - chessboard properly centered, but no box-shadow
      viewport units and calc() are not recognized in the
      context of box-shadow, even if those are properly interpreted
      to center the chessboard...

    Chrome 26.0 for Windows .......... [partially OK]
    - displays rounding error at bottom of chessboard
    - properly scales the chessboard but doesn't position it properly
      (flags an invalid value for top and left)
    - no box-shadow

    Opera 12.5 for Windows ........... [FAIL]
    - chessboard not centered, no box shadow
      (does not implement viewport units nor calc())
   

  V0.3 - 8x8 chessboard background
  - Repeat the process for 8 stripes. Position of stripe n is :

    x = (n * 1/8) + x * (n * 1/8)

    leading to : x = n / 7  with n taking 8 values from 0 to 7

      Chrome 26.0 for Windows .......... [partially OK]
      - displays rounding error at bottom of chessboard

  V0.2 - 2 stripes of 8 black and white cells
  - The tricky part as annouced by Bert Bos during his talk,
    is about computing the right percentage for background-position :

    background-position: 0 0, 14.286% 0;

    According to the CSS specification
    http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-position :

      "A percentage X aligns the point X% across (..) the image
       with the point X% across (..) the element's padding box."

    If our stripes are 1/8 of the total width and calling x the searched
    fraction we have :

            1/8 (width of the first stripe)
      + x * 1/8 (fraction of the second stripes's width) 
      = x       (fraction of the total width)
  
    which results in x = 1/7 (or 14.286 once multiplied by 100 to get % units)
 
  - Added IE 10.0 to tested browsers

  V0.1 - Vertical stripe of 8 black and white cells
  - Noticed Chrome rounding error at bottom of stripe - see 'V0.1 Chrome.png'
