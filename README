  Tested with
    Firefox 20.0 for Windows

    Opera 12.5 for Windows
    Internet Explorer 10.0 for Windows

  V0.3
  - Repeat the process for 8 stripes. Position of stripe n is :

    x = (n * 1/8) + x * (n * 1/8)

    leading to : x = n / 7  with n taking 8 values from 0 to 7

  V0.2 
  - The tricky part as annouced by Bert Bos during his talk, is about computing the right percentage for background-position :

    background-position: 0 0, 14.286% 0;

    The CSS specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-position says :

      "A percentage X aligns the point X% across (..) the image with the point X% across (..) the element's padding box."

    If our stripes are 1/8 of the total width and according to the specs, if we call x the searched fraction we have :

      x (fraction of the total width) = 1/8 (width of the first stripe) + x * 1/8 (fraction of the second stripes's width) 
  
    which results in : x = 1/7 (or 14.286 once multiplied by 100 to get % units)
 
  - Added IE 10.0 to tested browsers

  V0.1
  - Noticed Chrome rounding error at bottom of stripe - see 'V0.1 Chrome.png'
