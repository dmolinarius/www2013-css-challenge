=====================

This repo shows a step-by-step solution to the [WWW2013 CSS Challenge][] proposed
by [Bert Bos][] and [Bernard De Luna][].

The challenge consists in creating an entire chessboard using only CSS (no images).
The goal is to create a detailed board eventually including pieces.

To understand how the solution is built, simply look at the various chessboard.html files
located in the v0.n subdirectories, which contain also a README file and some
screendumps to see the result in various currently available browsers (as of 06/2013).

Have fun !
