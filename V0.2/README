  - The tricky part as announced by Bert Bos during his talk, is about computing
    the right percentage for background-position :

    background-position: 0 0, 14.286% 0;

    The CSS specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/colors.html#propdef-background-position
    says :

      "A percentage X aligns the point X% across (..) the image with the point
       X% across (..) the element's padding box."

    If our stripes are 1/8 of the total width and according to the specs, if we call x
    the searched fraction we have :

      x (fraction of the total width) = 1/8 (width of the first stripe) + x * 1/8 (fraction of the second stripes's width)
  
    which results in : x = 1/7 (or 14.286 once multiplied by 100 to get % units)
